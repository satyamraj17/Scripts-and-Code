This is a fun cipher idea I got randomly. It works like this:

Each letter's cipher is generated by tracing the letter on the numpad of the keyboard.

'A' is made like this:

'B' is made like this:

And so on...

Some of the letters are mapped differently to avoid overlapping with the other letters-- for example, the standard cipher for 'L' would otherwise match the beginning of the cipher for 'E' and 'U'.

Currently, this encoder-decoder doesn't take punctuation marks and symbols into consideration. Using them will throw an error.
